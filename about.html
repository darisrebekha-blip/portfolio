  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello everyone,<br><br>

    My name is <strong>Daris Rebekha S</strong>, and I am a beginner web developer who is passionate about learning how the web works and how ideas can be transformed into functional, user-friendly websites.

    <br><br>

    I started learning web development because I was fascinated by how websites are designed, built, and maintained behind the scenes. I am currently focusing on building a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    <br><br>

    I enjoy practicing by building small projects, fixing bugs, and improving my problem-solving skills. My goal is to become a confident and skilled web developer.
